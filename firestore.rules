/**
 * This ruleset enforces a shared-access security model for a couple's financial app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is centered around a "couple" entity, which acts as the
 * primary access control gate for all shared data. Users have private profiles,
 * but all financial data (expenses, loans, etc.) is shared between the two
 * members of a couple. Access is granted based on membership, not individual ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profiles, accessible only by the owner.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Globally readable list of expense categories for all signed-in users.
 * - /couples/{coupleId}: A central document representing the couple. It contains a `members`
 *   map with the UIDs of both partners, granting them access to all nested subcollections.
 * - /couples/{coupleId}/[expenses|loans|monthlyConsolidated]/{docId}: Subcollections
 *   containing the couple's shared financial data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Listing is Disabled: To protect user privacy, it is not possible to list all
 *   documents in the `/users` or `/couples` collections. Client applications must know the
 *   specific ID of a document to access it.
 * - Read-Only Shared Data: The `/categories` collection is treated as seeded data,
 *   allowing any signed-in user to read them but preventing any modifications.
 * - Authorization via Membership: Access to all shared data under `/couples/{coupleId}`
 *   is controlled by the `members` map on the parent `couple` document. For performance
 *   and transactional integrity, this `members` map is expected to be denormalized
 *   onto each document within the subcollections (e.g., each expense document).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To create simpler and more performant rules, authorization data is denormalized.
 * The `members` map from `/couples/{coupleId}` should be copied directly onto every
 * `expense`, `loan`, and `monthlyConsolidated` document. This avoids slow and costly
 * `get()` calls on `update` and `delete` operations, ensuring rules are fast and

 * reliable. For securing `list` and `create` operations on subcollections, a single
 * `get()` call to the parent document is used, which is an efficient and standard practice.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data is cleanly segregated. Private user data is isolated in `/users`.
 * Shared collaborative data is nested under `/couples`. Publicly readable data resides
 * in `/categories`. This separation creates clear and secure access boundaries.
